 The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations
 for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.

 In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
 modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only

 In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
 and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
 the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
 complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
 developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
 knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
 suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
 enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
 more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
 security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
 provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
 removed herefrom.
 .
 This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
 the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
